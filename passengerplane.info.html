                    <h2>Fuselage</h2>
                    <p>The fuselage is the main body of the airplane and one of its primary structures. It houses the cockpit, where the pilots control the aircraft; the cabin, where passengers sit; and cargo storage areas. The design considerations for the fuselage include its aerodynamic properties and structural integrity, which must support the weight of passengers, crew, and cargo, as well as withstand various stressors during flight.</p>

                    <h2>Wings</h2>
                    <p>Wings are critical for generating lift, enabling the aircraft to fly. They are attached to either side of the fuselage and vary in design depending on the specific performance characteristics desired, such as speed, range, and fuel efficiency. Modern aircraft wings may also incorporate advanced wingtip devices like winglets or sharklets, which improve aerodynamics by reducing drag, thereby enhancing fuel efficiency.</p>

                    <h2>Engines</h2>
                    <p>Engines are what give the airplane the power to fly. They are typically mounted on the wings or the rear of the fuselage. Commercial jet aircraft use turbofan engines that draw in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and ignite the mixture to generate thrust. The efficiency, reliability, and power output of the engines are crucial for the aircraft's performance, particularly in terms of speed and fuel economy.</p>

                    <h2>Tail Assembly</h2>
                    <p>The tail section of an airplane consists of the vertical stabilizer (or fin) and the horizontal stabilizers. These surfaces help to stabilize the aircraft and control its attitude in pitch and yaw. The rudder, attached to the vertical stabilizer, and the elevators, attached to the horizontal stabilizers, are movable surfaces that help the pilot direct the aircraft.</p>

                    <p>The landing gear supports the aircraft when it is not in the air. It includes wheels, brakes, and struts that absorb shocks during landing and taxiing. The main landing gear is located near the center of gravity of the aircraft, and a smaller nose gear is situated at the front. In most large aircraft, the landing gear can be retracted into the body during flight to reduce drag.</p>

                    <p>Besides the rudder and elevators, other primary flight control surfaces include ailerons and spoilers. Ailerons, located at the trailing edges of the wings, control roll about the longitudinal axis. Spoilers, also located on the wings, can reduce lift and increase drag, aiding in descent and roll control.</p>

These systems include navigation aids such as GPS, communication radios, and various other flight management tools. Avionics also ensure safety through systems like weather radars, collision avoidance systems, and black boxes (flight recorders).</p>
